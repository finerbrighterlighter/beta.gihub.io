# About me

From Myanmar (Burma), but I consider myself a citizen of where I am sleeping today. 

I did practice dentistry until the graduation in 2018 and never looked back since. 

Currently based in Bangkok Thailand, I am working in the field of health care research, concentrating in data science and clinical data research. Mainly interested in secondary data research, I am enthused to explore why we should reuse, what we should reuse, how we should reuse regarding electronic medical records and data collected for other purposes. I mainly work with Python with occasional R for resource limitations.

In my free time, I prefer to keep myself in my room, listening to music, walking around with a headset or watching tv shows on repeat.

Here's a playlist of my most listened songs in [2022](https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2019/pl.rp-BooEUbOj66bP "Replay 2022"), [2021](https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2021/pl.rp-8AA9cXvO44Xo "Replay 2021"), [2020](https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2020/pl.rp-P449SYAZaaYV "Replay 2020"), and [2019](https://music.apple.com/th/playlist/replay-2019/pl.rp-BooEUbOj66bP "Replay 2019"). And yes, Hamilton was released on Disney+ in 2020.
